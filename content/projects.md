      title: Selected Projects
      text: Thanks to the National Science Foundation (NSF), particularly the AGS (Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences) and OAC (Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure) directorates, for funding my research projects â€” including CAIG, SHINE, and CRII. This support has been instrumental in advancing our work at the intersection of computer science, machine learning, and space weather research.
