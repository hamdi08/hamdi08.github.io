This project integrates heliophysics and computer science by using NASA and NOAA solar observations with graph neural networks to improve solar flare prediction from multivariate magnetic field time series data. It will advance flare forecasting methods, train graduate and undergraduate students, and broaden participation in data science and space weather research through mentorship and distance learning programs.
