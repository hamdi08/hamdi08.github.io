abstract: Solar flares are characterized by sudden bursts of electromagnetic radiation
  from the Sunâ€™s surface, and are caused by the changes in magnetic field states in
  active solar regions. Earth and its surrounding space environment can suffer from
  various negative impacts caused by solar flares, ranging from electronic communication
  disruption to radiation exposure-based health risks to astronauts. In this paper,
  we address the solar flare prediction problem from magnetic field parameter-based
  multivariate time series (MVTS) data using multiple state-of-the-art machine learning
  classifiers that include MINImally RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (MiniRocket),
  Support Vector Machine (SVM), Canonical Interval Forest (CIF), Multiple Representations
  Sequence Learner (Mr-SEQL), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based deep learning
  model. Our experiment is conducted on the Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares
  (SWAN-SF) benchmark data set, which is a partitioned collection of MVTS data of
  active region magnetic field parameters spanning over nine years of operation of
  the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The MVTS instances of the SWAN-SF dataset
  are labeled by GOES X-ray flux-based flare class labels, and attributed to extreme
  class imbalance because of the rarity of the major flaring events (e.g., X and M).
  As a performance validation metric in this class-imbalanced dataset, we used the
  True Skill Statistic (TSS) score. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of the
  MVTS learning algorithm MiniRocket, which outperformed the aforementioned classifiers
  without the need for essential data preprocessing steps such as normalization, statistical
  summarization, and class imbalance handling heuristics.
