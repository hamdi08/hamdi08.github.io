abstract: 'We introduce and make openly accessible a comprehensive, multivariate time
  series (MVTS) dataset extracted from solar photospheric vector magnetograms in Spaceweather
  HMI Active Region Patch (SHARP) series. Our dataset also includes a cross-checked
  NOAA solar flare catalog that immediately facilitates solar flare prediction efforts.
  We discuss methods used for data collection, cleaning and pre-processing of the
  solar active region and flare data, and we further describe a novel data integration
  and sampling methodology. Our dataset covers 4,098 MVTS data collections from active
  regions occurring between May 2010 and December 2018, includes 51 flare-predictive
  parameters, and integrates over 10,000 flare reports. Potential directions toward
  expansion of the time series, either “horizontally” – by adding more prediction-specific
  parameters, or “vertically” – by generalizing flare into integrated solar eruption
  prediction, are also explained. The immediate tasks enabled by the disseminated
  dataset include: optimization of solar flare prediction and detailed investigation
  for elusive flare predictors or precursors, with both operational (research-to-operations),
  and basic research (operations-to-research) benefits potentially following in the
  future.'
