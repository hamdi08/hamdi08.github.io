abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, in particular high-energy-range SEP
  events, pose significant risks to space missions, astronauts, and technological
  infrastructure. Accurate prediction of these high-impact events is crucial for mitigating
  potential hazards. In this study, we present an end-to-end ensemble machine learning
  (ML) framework for the prediction of high-impact âˆ¼100 MeV SEP events. Our approach
  leverages diverse data modalities sourced from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
  and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite integrating extracted
  active region polygons from solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagery, time-series
  proton flux measurements, sunspot activity data, and detailed active region characteristics.
  To quantify the predictive contribution of each data modality (e.g., EUV or time
  series), we independently evaluate them using a range of ML models to assess their
  performance in forecasting SEP events. Finally, to enhance the SEP predictive performance,
  we train an ensemble learning model that combines all the models trained on individual
  data modalities, leveraging the strengths of each data modality. Our proposed ensemble
  approach shows promising performance, achieving a recall of 0.80 and 0.75 in balanced
  and imbalanced settings, respectively, underscoring the effectiveness of multimodal
  data integration for robust SEP event prediction and enhanced forecasting capabilities.
