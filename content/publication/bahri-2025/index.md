abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events pose significant risks to both space
  and ground-level infrastructure, as well as to human health in space. Understanding
  and predicting these events are critical for mitigating their potential impacts.
  In this paper, we address the challenge of predicting SEP events using proton flux
  data. We leverage some of the most recent advances in time series data mining, such
  as shapelets and the matrix profile, to propose a simple and easily understandable
  prediction approach. Our objective is to mitigate the interpretability challenges
  inherent to most machine learning models and to show that other methods exist that
  can not only yield accurate forecasts but also facilitate exploration and insight
  generation within the data domain. For this purpose, we construct a multivariate
  time series data set consisting of proton flux data recorded by the National Oceanic
  and Atmospheric Administration's geosynchronous orbit Earth-observing satellite.
  Then, we use our proposed approach to mine shapelets and make predictions using
  a random forest classifier. We demonstrate that our approach rivals state-of-the-art
  SEP prediction, offering superior interpretability and the ability to predict SEP
  events before their parent eruptive flares.
