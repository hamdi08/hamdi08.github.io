abstract: 'Solar wind modeling is classified into two main types: empirical models
  and physics-based models, each designed to forecast solar wind properties in various
  regions of the heliosphere. Empirical models, which are cost-effective, have demonstrated
  significant accuracy in predicting solar wind at the L1 Lagrange point. On the other
  hand, physics-based models rely on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) principles and demand
  more computational resources. In this research paper, we build upon our recent novel
  approach that merges empirical and physics-based models. Our recent proposal involves
  the creation of a new physics-informed neural network that leverages time series
  data from solar wind predictors to enhance solar wind prediction. This innovative
  method aims to combine the strengths of both modeling approaches to achieve more
  accurate and efficient solar wind predictions. In this work, we show the variability
  of the proposed physics-informed loss across multiple deep learning models. We also
  study the effect of training the models on different solar cycles on the modelâ€™s
  performance. This work represents the first effort to predict solar wind by integrating
  deep learning approaches with physics constraints and analyzing the results across
  three solar cycles. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of our physics-constrained
  model over other unconstrained deep learning predictive models.'
