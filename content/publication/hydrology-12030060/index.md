abstract: Streamflow prediction is vital for effective water resource management,
  enabling a better understanding of hydrological variability and its response to
  environmental factors. This study presents a spatio-temporal graph neural network
  (STGNN) model for streamflow prediction in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB),
  integrating graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model spatial connectivity and
  long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dynamics. Using 30 years
  of monthly streamflow data from 20 monitoring stations, the STGNN predicted streamflow
  over a 36-month horizon and was evaluated against traditional models, including
  random forest regression (RFR), LSTM, gated recurrent units (GRU), and seasonal
  auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA). The STGNN outperformed these
  models across multiple metrics, achieving an R2 of 0.78, an RMSE of 0.81 mm/month,
  and a KGE of 0.79 at critical locations like Lees Ferry. A sequential analysis of
  inputâ€“output configurations identified the (36, 36) setup as optimal for balancing
  historical context and forecasting accuracy. Additionally, the STGNN showed strong
  generalizability when applied to other locations within the UCRB. These results
  underscore the importance of integrating spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics
  in hydrological forecasting, offering a scalable and adaptable framework to improve
  predictive accuracy and support adaptive water resource management in river basins.
