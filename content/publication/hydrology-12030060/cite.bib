 abstract = {Streamflow prediction is vital for effective water resource management, enabling a better understanding of hydrological variability and its response to environmental factors. This study presents a spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGNN) model for streamflow prediction in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB), integrating graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model spatial connectivity and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dynamics. Using 30 years of monthly streamflow data from 20 monitoring stations, the STGNN predicted streamflow over a 36-month horizon and was evaluated against traditional models, including random forest regression (RFR), LSTM, gated recurrent units (GRU), and seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA). The STGNN outperformed these models across multiple metrics, achieving an R2 of 0.78, an RMSE of 0.81 mm/month, and a KGE of 0.79 at critical locations like Lees Ferry. A sequential analysis of inputâ€“output configurations identified the (36, 36) setup as optimal for balancing historical context and forecasting accuracy. Additionally, the STGNN showed strong generalizability when applied to other locations within the UCRB. These results underscore the importance of integrating spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics in hydrological forecasting, offering a scalable and adaptable framework to improve predictive accuracy and support adaptive water resource management in river basins.},
