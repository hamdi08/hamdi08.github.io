abstract: "BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for gender dysphoria is medical intervention,
  but many transgender and nonbinary people face significant treatment barriers when
  seeking help for gender dysphoria. When untreated, gender dysphoria is associated
  with depression, anxiety, suicidality, and substance misuse. Technology-delivered
  interventions for transgender and nonbinary people can be used discretely, safely,
  and flexibly, thereby reducing treatment barriers and increasing access to psychological
  interventions to manage distress that accompanies gender dysphoria. Technology-delivered
  interventions are beginning to incorporate machine learning (ML) and natural language
  processing (NLP) to automate intervention components and tailor intervention content.
  A critical step in using ML and NLP in technology-delivered interventions is demonstrating
  how accurately these methods model clinical constructs. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed
  to determine the preliminary effectiveness of modeling gender dysphoria with ML
  and NLP, using transgender and nonbinary people's social media data. METHODS: Overall,
  6 ML models and 949 NLP-generated independent variables were used to model gender
  dysphoria from the text data of 1573 Reddit posts created on transgender- and nonbinary-specific
  web-based forums. After developing a codebook grounded in clinical science, a research
  team of clinicians and students experienced in working with transgender and nonbinary
  clients used qualitative content analysis to determine whether gender dysphoria
  was present in each Reddit post. NLP (e.g., n-grams, LIWC, word embedding, sentiment,
  and transfer learning) was used to transform the linguistic content of each post
  into predictors for ML algorithms. A k-fold cross-validation was performed. Hyperparameters
  were tuned with random search. Feature selection was performed to demonstrate the
  relative importance of each NLP-generated independent variable. Misclassified posts
  were analyzed to improve future modeling of gender dysphoria. RESULTS: An optimized
  extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm modeled gender dysphoria with high
  accuracy (0.84), precision (0.83), and speed (1.23s). DSM-5 clinical keywords were
  most predictive. Misclassifications occurred in posts with uncertainty, unrelated
  stress, insufficient markers, past experiences, or identity exploration. CONCLUSIONS:
  ML- and NLP-based models of gender dysphoria have strong potential to be integrated
  into technology-delivered interventions and contribute to clinical science for marginalized
  populations."
