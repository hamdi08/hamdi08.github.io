 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for gender dysphoria is medical intervention, but many transgender and nonbinary people face significant treatment barriers when seeking help for gender dysphoria. When untreated, gender dysphoria is associated with depression, anxiety, suicidality, and substance misuse. Technology-delivered interventions for transgender and nonbinary people can be used discretely, safely, and flexibly, thereby reducing treatment barriers and increasing access to psychological interventions to manage distress that accompanies gender dysphoria. Technology-delivered interventions are beginning to incorporate machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to automate intervention components and tailor intervention content. A critical step in using ML and NLP in technology-delivered interventions is demonstrating how accurately these methods model clinical constructs. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the preliminary effectiveness of modeling gender dysphoria with ML and NLP, using transgender and nonbinary people's social media data. METHODS: Overall, 6 ML models and 949 NLP-generated independent variables were used to model gender dysphoria from the text data of 1573 Reddit posts created on transgender- and nonbinary-specific web-based forums. After developing a codebook grounded in clinical science, a research team of clinicians and students experienced in working with transgender and nonbinary clients used qualitative content analysis to determine whether gender dysphoria was present in each Reddit post. NLP (e.g., n-grams, LIWC, word embedding, sentiment, and transfer learning) was used to transform the linguistic content of each post into predictors for ML algorithms. A k-fold cross-validation was performed. Hyperparameters were tuned with random search. Feature selection was performed to demonstrate the relative importance of each NLP-generated independent variable. Misclassified posts were analyzed to improve future modeling of gender dysphoria. RESULTS: An optimized extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm modeled gender dysphoria with high accuracy (0.84), precision (0.83), and speed (1.23s). DSM-5 clinical keywords were most predictive. Misclassifications occurred in posts with uncertainty, unrelated stress, insufficient markers, past experiences, or identity exploration. CONCLUSIONS: ML- and NLP-based models of gender dysphoria have strong potential to be integrated into technology-delivered interventions and contribute to clinical science for marginalized populations.},
