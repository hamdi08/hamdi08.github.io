 abstract = {Photospheric magnetic field parameters are frequently used to analyze and predict solar events. Observation of these parameters over time, i.e., representing solar events by multivariate time-series (MVTS) data, can determine relationships between magnetic field states in active regions and extreme solar events, e.g., solar flares. We can improve our understanding of these events by selecting the most relevant parameters that give the highest predictive performance. In this study, we propose a two-step incremental feature selection method for MVTS data using a deep-learning model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. First, each MVTS feature (magnetic field parameter) is evaluated individually by a univariate sequence classifier utilizing an LSTM network. Then, the top performing features are combined to produce input for an LSTM-based multivariate sequence classifier. Finally, we tested the discrimination ability of the selected features by training downstream classifiers, e.g., Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform and support vector machine. We performed our experiments using a benchmark data set for flare prediction known as Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares. We compared our proposed method with three other baseline feature selection methods and demonstrated that our method selects more discriminatory features compared to other methods. Due to the imbalanced nature of the data, primarily caused by the rarity of minority flare classes (e.g., the X and M classes), we used the true skill statistic as the evaluation metric. Finally, we reported the set of photospheric magnetic field parameters that give the highest discrimination performance in predicting flare classes.},
