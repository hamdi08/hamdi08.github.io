 abstract = {The opacity inherent in machine learning models presents a significant hindrance to their widespread incorporation into decision-making processes. To address this challenge and foster trust among stakeholders while ensuring decision fairness, the data mining community has been actively advancing the explainable artificial intelligence paradigm. This paper contributes to the evolving field by focusing on counterfactual generation for time series classification models, a domain where research is relatively scarce. We develop, a post-hoc, model agnostic counterfactual explanation algorithm that leverages the Matrix Profile to map time series discords to their nearest neighbors in a target sequence and use this mapping to generate new counterfactual instances. To our knowledge, this is the first effort towards the use of time series discords for counterfactual explanations. We evaluate our algorithm on the University of California Riverside and University of East Anglia archives and compare it to three state-of-the-art univariate and multivariate methods.},
