abstract: The opacity inherent in machine learning models presents a significant hindrance
  to their widespread incorporation into decision-making processes. To address this
  challenge and foster trust among stakeholders while ensuring decision fairness,
  the data mining community has been actively advancing the explainable artificial
  intelligence paradigm. This paper contributes to the evolving field by focusing
  on counterfactual generation for time series classification models, a domain where
  research is relatively scarce. We develop, a post-hoc, model agnostic counterfactual
  explanation algorithm that leverages the Matrix Profile to map time series discords
  to their nearest neighbors in a target sequence and use this mapping to generate
  new counterfactual instances. To our knowledge, this is the first effort towards
  the use of time series discords for counterfactual explanations. We evaluate our
  algorithm on the University of California Riverside and University of East Anglia
  archives and compare it to three state-of-the-art univariate and multivariate methods.
