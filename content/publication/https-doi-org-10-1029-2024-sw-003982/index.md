abstract: Abstract Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, originating from solar flares
  and Coronal Mass Ejections, present significant hazards to space exploration and
  technology on Earth. Accurate prediction of these high-energy events is essential
  for safeguarding astronauts, spacecraft, and electronic systems. In this study,
  we conduct an in-depth investigation into the application of multimodal data fusion
  techniques for the prediction of high-energy SEP events, particularly ∼100 MeV events.
  Our research utilizes six machine learning (ML) models, each finely tuned for time
  series analysis, including Univariate Time Series (UTS), Image-based model (Image),
  Univariate Feature Concatenation (UFC), Univariate Deep Concatenation (UDC), Univariate
  Deep Merge (UDM), and Univariate Score Concatenation (USC). By combining time series
  proton flux data with solar X-ray images, we exploit complementary insights into
  the underlying solar phenomena responsible for SEP events. Rigorous evaluation metrics,
  including accuracy, F1-score, and other established measures, are applied, along
  with K-fold cross-validation, to ensure the robustness and generalization of our
  models. Additionally, we explore the influence of observation window sizes on classification
  accuracy.
