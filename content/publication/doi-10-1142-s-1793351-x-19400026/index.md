abstract: ' The comprehensive set of neuronal connections of the human brain, which
  is known as the human connectomes, has provided valuable insight into neurological
  and neurodevelopmental disorders. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has
  facilitated this research by capturing regionally specific brain activity. Resting
  state fMRI is used to extract the functional connectivity networks, which are edge-weighted
  complete graphs. In these complete functional connectivity networks, each node represents
  one brain region or Region of Interest (ROI), and each edge weight represents the
  strength of functional connectivity of the adjacent ROIs. In order to leverage existing
  graph mining methodologies, these complete graphs are often made sparse by applying
  thresholds on weights. This approach can result in loss of discriminative information
  while addressing the issue of biomarkers detection, i.e. finding discriminative
  ROIs and connections, given the data of healthy and disabled population. In this
  work, we demonstrate a novel framework for representing the complete functional
  connectivity networks in a threshold-free manner and identifying biomarkers by using
  feature selection algorithms. Additionally, to compute meaningful representations
  of the discriminative ROIs and connections, we apply tensor decomposition techniques.
  Experiments on a fMRI dataset of neurodevelopmental reading disabilities show the
  highly interpretable nature of our approach in finding the biomarkers of the diseases. '
