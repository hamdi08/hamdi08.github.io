abstract: Solar flares are significant occurrences in solar physics, impacting space
  weather and terrestrial technologies. Accurate classification of solar flares is
  essential for predicting space weather and minimizing potential disruptions to communication,
  navigation, and power systems. This study addresses the challenge of selecting the
  most relevant features from multivariate time-series data, specifically focusing
  on solar flares. We employ methods such as Mutual Information (MI), Minimum Redundancy
  Maximum Relevance (mRMR), and Euclidean Distance to identify key features for classification.
  Recognizing the performance variability of different feature selection techniques,
  we introduce an ensemble approach to compute feature weights. By combining outputs
  from multiple methods, our ensemble method provides a more comprehensive understanding
  of the importance of features. Our results show that the ensemble approach significantly
  improves classification performance, achieving values 0.15 higher in True Skill
  Statistic (TSS) values compared to individual feature selection methods. Additionally,
  our method offers valuable insights into the underlying physical processes of solar
  flares, leading to more effective space weather forecasting and enhanced mitigation
  strategies for communication, navigation, and power system disruptions.
