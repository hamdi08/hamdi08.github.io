abstract: The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive resource for the
  selection of data representations for machine learning-oriented models and components
  in solar flare prediction tasks. Major solar flares occurring in the solar corona
  and heliosphere can bring potential destructive consequences, posing significant
  risks to astronauts, space stations, electronics, communication systems, and numerous
  technological infrastructures. For this reason, the accurate detection of major
  flares is essential for mitigating these hazards and ensuring the safety of our
  technology-dependent society. In response, leveraging machine learning techniques
  for predicting solar flares has emerged as a significant application within the
  realm of data science, relying on sensor data collected from solar active region
  photospheric magnetic fields by space- and ground-based observatories. In this research,
  three distinct solar flare prediction strategies utilizing the photospheric magnetic
  field parameter-based multivariate time series dataset are evaluated, with a focus
  on data representation techniques. Specifically, we examine vector-based, time series-based,
  and graph-based approaches to identify the most effective data representation for
  capturing key characteristics of the dataset. The vector-based approach condenses
  multivariate time series into a compressed vector form, the time series representation
  leverages temporal patterns, and the graph-based method models interdependencies
  between magnetic field parameters. The results demonstrate that the vector representation
  approach exhibits exceptional robustness in predicting solar flares, consistently
  yielding strong and reliable classification outcomes by effectively encapsulating
  the intricate relationships within photospheric magnetic field data when coupled
  with appropriate downstream machine learning classifiers.
