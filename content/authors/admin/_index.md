## About Me

Shah Muhammad Hamdi is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Utah State University. His research develops machine learning techniques tailored to multivariate time series and graph data, with applications to the prediction and analysis of extreme solar events such as solar flares and solar energetic particles. He leads the design of ML-based cyberinfrastructure to integrate heterogeneous, large-scale scientific data and support reproducible forecasting workflows for the space weather community. Beyond heliophysics, his group applies these methods to hydrology, focusing on streamflow prediction in river basins, and to computational social science, curating datasets for detecting psychological stress from social media. Hamdi has secured over $1.3M in extramural funding, published more than 70 refereed papers, and was recognized as the Outstanding Computer Science Faculty Researcher of the Year in 2024.
