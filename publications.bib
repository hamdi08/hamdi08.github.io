ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive resource for the selection of data representations for machine learning-oriented models and components in solar flare prediction tasks. Major solar flares occurring in the solar corona and heliosphere can bring potential destructive consequences, posing significant risks to astronauts, space stations, electronics, communication systems, and numerous technological infrastructures. For this reason, the accurate detection of major flares is essential for mitigating these hazards and ensuring the safety of our technology-dependent society. In response, leveraging machine learning techniques for predicting solar flares has emerged as a significant application within the realm of data science, relying on sensor data collected from solar active region photospheric magnetic fields by space- and ground-based observatories. In this research, three distinct solar flare prediction strategies utilizing the photospheric magnetic field parameter-based multivariate time series dataset are evaluated, with a focus on data representation techniques. Specifically, we examine vector-based, time series-based, and graph-based approaches to identify the most effective data representation for capturing key characteristics of the dataset. The vector-based approach condenses multivariate time series into a compressed vector form, the time series representation leverages temporal patterns, and the graph-based method models interdependencies between magnetic field parameters. The results demonstrate that the vector representation approach exhibits exceptional robustness in predicting solar flares, consistently yielding strong and reliable classification outcomes by effectively encapsulating the intricate relationships within photospheric magnetic field data when coupled with appropriate downstream machine learning classifiers.},

abstract = {Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, in particular high-energy-range SEP events, pose significant risks to space missions, astronauts, and technological infrastructure. Accurate prediction of these high-impact events is crucial for mitigating potential hazards. In this study, we present an end-to-end ensemble machine learning (ML) framework for the prediction of high-impact ∼100 MeV SEP events. Our approach leverages diverse data modalities sourced from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite integrating extracted active region polygons from solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagery, time-series proton flux measurements, sunspot activity data, and detailed active region characteristics. To quantify the predictive contribution of each data modality (e.g., EUV or time series), we independently evaluate them using a range of ML models to assess their performance in forecasting SEP events. Finally, to enhance the SEP predictive performance, we train an ensemble learning model that combines all the models trained on individual data modalities, leveraging the strengths of each data modality. Our proposed ensemble approach shows promising performance, achieving a recall of 0.80 and 0.75 in balanced and imbalanced settings, respectively, underscoring the effectiveness of multimodal data integration for robust SEP event prediction and enhanced forecasting capabilities.}

Understanding and predicting these events are critical for mitigating their potential impacts. In this paper, we address the challenge of predicting SEP events using proton flux data. We leverage some of the most recent advances in time series data mining, such as shapelets and the matrix profile, to propose a simple and easily understandable prediction approach. Our objective is to mitigate the interpretability challenges inherent to most machine learning models and to show that other methods exist that can not only yield accurate forecasts but also facilitate exploration and insight generation within the data domain. For this purpose, we construct a multivariate time series data set consisting of proton flux data recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's geosynchronous orbit Earth-observing satellite. Then, we use our proposed approach to mine shapelets and make predictions using a random forest classifier. We demonstrate that our approach rivals state-of-the-art SEP prediction, offering superior interpretability and the ability to predict SEP events before their parent eruptive flares.}

ABSTRACT = {As the demand for interpretable machine learning approaches continues to grow, there is an increasing necessity for human involvement in providing informative explanations for model decisions. This is necessary for building trust and transparency in AI-based systems, leading to the emergence of the Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) field. Recently, a novel counterfactual explanation model, CELS, has been introduced. CELS learns a saliency map for the interests of an instance and generates a counterfactual explanation guided by the learned saliency map. While CELS represents the first attempt to exploit learned saliency maps not only to provide intuitive explanations for the reason behind the decision made by the time series classifier but also to explore post hoc counterfactual explanations, it exhibits limitations in terms of its high validity for the sake of ensuring high proximity and sparsity. In this paper, we present an enhanced approach that builds upon CELS. While the original model achieved promising results in terms of sparsity and proximity, it faced limitations in terms of validity. Our proposed method addresses this limitation by removing mask normalization to provide more informative and valid counterfactual explanations. Through extensive experimentation on datasets from various domains, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms the CELS model, achieving higher validity and producing more informative explanations.},

ABSTRACT = {Streamflow prediction is vital for effective water resource management, enabling a better understanding of hydrological variability and its response to environmental factors. This study presents a spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGNN) model for streamflow prediction in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB), integrating graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model spatial connectivity and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dynamics. Using 30 years of monthly streamflow data from 20 monitoring stations, the STGNN predicted streamflow over a 36-month horizon and was evaluated against traditional models, including random forest regression (RFR), LSTM, gated recurrent units (GRU), and seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA). The STGNN outperformed these models across multiple metrics, achieving an R2 of 0.78, an RMSE of 0.81 mm/month, and a KGE of 0.79 at critical locations like Lees Ferry. A sequential analysis of input–output configurations identified the (36, 36) setup as optimal for balancing historical context and forecasting accuracy. Additionally, the STGNN showed strong generalizability when applied to other locations within the UCRB. These results underscore the importance of integrating spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics in hydrological forecasting, offering a scalable and adaptable framework to improve predictive accuracy and support adaptive water resource management in river basins.},

abstract = {The accurate prediction of solar flares is crucial due to their risks to astronauts, space equipment, and satellite communication systems. Our research enhances solar flare prediction by employing sophisticated data preprocessing and sampling techniques for the Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares (SWAN-SF) data set, a rich source of multivariate time series data of solar active regions. Our study adopts a multifaceted approach encompassing four key methodologies. Initially, we address over 10 million missing values in the SWAN-SF data set through our innovative imputation technique called fast Pearson correlation-based k-nearest neighbors imputation. Subsequently, we propose a precise normalization technique, called LSBZM normalization, tailored for time series data, merging various strategies (log, square root, Box–Cox, Z-score, and min–max) to uniformly scale the data set's 24 attributes (photospheric magnetic field parameters), addressing issues such as skewness. We also explore the “near decision boundary sample removal” technique to enhance the classification performance of the data set by effectively resolving the challenge of class overlap. Finally, a pivotal aspect of our research is a thorough evaluation of diverse oversampling and undersampling methods, including SMOTE, ADASYN, Gaussian noise injection, TimeGAN, Tomek links, and random undersampling, to counter the severe imbalance in the SWAN-SF data set, notably a 60:1 ratio of major (X and M) to minor (C, B, and FQ) flaring events in binary classification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, we use eight classification algorithms, including advanced deep-learning-based architectures. Our analysis shows significant true skill statistic scores, underscoring the importance of data preprocessing and sampling in time-series-based solar flare prediction.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
abstract = {Photospheric magnetic field parameters are frequently used to analyze and predict solar events. Observation of these parameters over time, i.e., representing solar events by multivariate time-series (MVTS) data, can determine relationships between magnetic field states in active regions and extreme solar events, e.g., solar flares. We can improve our understanding of these events by selecting the most relevant parameters that give the highest predictive performance. In this study, we propose a two-step incremental feature selection method for MVTS data using a deep-learning model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. First, each MVTS feature (magnetic field parameter) is evaluated individually by a univariate sequence classifier utilizing an LSTM network. Then, the top performing features are combined to produce input for an LSTM-based multivariate sequence classifier. Finally, we tested the discrimination ability of the selected features by training downstream classifiers, e.g., Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform and support vector machine. We performed our experiments using a benchmark data set for flare prediction known as Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares. We compared our proposed method with three other baseline feature selection methods and demonstrated that our method selects more discriminatory features compared to other methods. Due to the imbalanced nature of the data, primarily caused by the rarity of minority flare classes (e.g., the X and M classes), we used the true skill statistic as the evaluation metric. Finally, we reported the set of photospheric magnetic field parameters that give the highest discrimination performance in predicting flare classes.}

title = {Improving Solar Energetic Particle Event Prediction through Multivariate Time Series Data Augmentation},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
abstract = {Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are associated with extreme solar events that can cause major damage to space- and ground-based life and infrastructure. High-intensity SEP events, particularly ∼100 MeV SEP events, can pose severe health risks for astronauts owing to radiation exposure and affect Earth’s orbiting satellites (e.g., Landsat and the International Space Station). A major challenge in the SEP event prediction task is the lack of adequate SEP data because of the rarity of these events. In this work, we aim to improve the prediction of ∼30, ∼60, and ∼100 MeV SEP events by synthetically increasing the number of SEP samples. We explore the use of a univariate and multivariate time series of proton flux data as input to machine-learning-based prediction methods, such as time series forest (TSF). Our study covers solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Our findings show that using data augmentation methods, such as the synthetic minority oversampling technique, remarkably increases the accuracy and F1-score of the classifiers used in this research, especially for TSF, where the average accuracy increased by 20%, reaching around 90% accuracy in the ∼100 MeV SEP prediction task. We also achieved higher prediction accuracy when using the multivariate time series data of the proton flux. Finally, we build a pipeline framework for our best-performing model, TSF, and provide a comprehensive hierarchical classification of the ∼100, ∼60, and ∼30 MeV and non-SEP prediction scenarios.}

By combining time series proton flux data with solar X-ray images, we exploit complementary insights into the underlying solar phenomena responsible for SEP events.

Additionally, we explore the influence of observation window sizes on classification accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Solar wind modeling is classified into two main types: empirical models and physics-based models, each designed to forecast solar wind properties in various regions of the heliosphere. Empirical models, which are cost-effective, have demonstrated significant accuracy in predicting solar wind at the L1 Lagrange point. On the other hand, physics-based models rely on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) principles and demand more computational resources. In this research paper, we build upon our recent novel approach that merges empirical and physics-based models. Our recent proposal involves the creation of a new physics-informed neural network that leverages time series data from solar wind predictors to enhance solar wind prediction. This innovative method aims to combine the strengths of both modeling approaches to achieve more accurate and efficient solar wind predictions. In this work, we show the variability of the proposed physics-informed loss across multiple deep learning models. We also study the effect of training the models on different solar cycles on the model’s performance. This work represents the first effort to predict solar wind by integrating deep learning approaches with physics constraints and analyzing the results across three solar cycles. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of our physics-constrained model over other unconstrained deep learning predictive models.},

abstract = {Abstract With increasing demands for precise water resource management, there is a growing need for advanced techniques in mapping water bodies. The currently deployed satellites provide complementary data that are either of high spatial or high temporal resolutions. As a result, there is a clear trade-off between space and time when considering a single data source. For the efficient monitoring of multiple environmental resources, various Earth science applications need data at high spatial and temporal resolutions. To address this need, many data fusion methods have been described in the literature, that rely on combining data snapshots from multiple sources. Traditional methods face limitations due to sensitivity to atmospheric disturbances and other environmental factors, resulting in noise, outliers, and missing data. This paper introduces Hydrological Generative Adversarial Network (Hydro-GAN), a novel machine learning-based method that utilizes modified GANs to enhance boundary accuracy when mapping low-resolution MODIS data to high-resolution Landsat-8 images. We propose a new non-saturating loss function for the Hydro-GAN generator, which maximizes the log of discriminator probabilities to promote stable updates and aid convergence. By focusing on reducing squared differences between real and synthetic images, our approach enhances training stability and overall performance. We specifically focus on mapping water bodies using MODIS and Landsat-8 imagery due to their relevance in water resource management tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Hydro-GAN in generating high-resolution water body maps, outperforming traditional methods in terms of boundary accuracy and overall quality.},

ABSTRACT = {Streamflow prediction is crucial for planning future developments and safety measures along river basins, especially in the face of changing climate patterns. In this study, we utilized monthly streamflow data from the United States Bureau of Reclamation and meteorological data (snow water equivalent, temperature, and precipitation) from the various weather monitoring stations of the Snow Telemetry Network within the Upper Colorado River Basin to forecast monthly streamflow at Lees Ferry, a specific location along the Colorado River in the basin. Four machine learning models—Random Forest Regression, Long short-term memory, Gated Recurrent Unit, and Seasonal AutoRegresive Integrated Moving Average—were trained using 30 years of monthly data (1991–2020), split into 80% for training (1991–2014) and 20% for testing (2015–2020). Initially, only historical streamflow data were used for predictions, followed by including meteorological factors to assess their impact on streamflow. Subsequently, sequence analysis was conducted to explore various input-output sequence window combinations. We then evaluated the influence of each factor on streamflow by testing all possible combinations to identify the optimal feature combination for prediction. Our results indicate that the Random Forest Regression model consistently outperformed others, especially after integrating all meteorological factors with historical streamflow data. The best performance was achieved with a 24-month look-back period to predict 12 months of streamflow, yielding a Root Mean Square Error of 2.25 and R-squared (R2) of 0.80. Finally, to assess model generalizability, we tested the best model at other locations—Greenwood Springs (Colorado River), Maybell (Yampa River), and Archuleta (San Juan) in the basin.},

To address this challenge and foster trust among stakeholders while ensuring decision fairness, the data mining community has been actively advancing the explainable artificial intelligence paradigm. This paper contributes to the evolving field by focusing on counterfactual generation for time series classification models, a domain where research is relatively scarce. We develop, a post-hoc, model agnostic counterfactual explanation algorithm that leverages the Matrix Profile to map time series discords to their nearest neighbors in a target sequence and use this mapping to generate new counterfactual instances. To our knowledge, this is the first effort towards the use of time series discords for counterfactual explanations. We evaluate our algorithm on the University of California Riverside and University of East Anglia archives and compare it to three state-of-the-art univariate and multivariate methods.}

ABSTRACT = {Solar flares are characterized by sudden bursts of electromagnetic radiation from the Sun’s surface, and are caused by the changes in magnetic field states in active solar regions. Earth and its surrounding space environment can suffer from various negative impacts caused by solar flares, ranging from electronic communication disruption to radiation exposure-based health risks to astronauts. In this paper, we address the solar flare prediction problem from magnetic field parameter-based multivariate time series (MVTS) data using multiple state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers that include MINImally RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (MiniRocket), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Canonical Interval Forest (CIF), Multiple Representations Sequence Learner (Mr-SEQL), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based deep learning model. Our experiment is conducted on the Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares (SWAN-SF) benchmark data set, which is a partitioned collection of MVTS data of active region magnetic field parameters spanning over nine years of operation of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The MVTS instances of the SWAN-SF dataset are labeled by GOES X-ray flux-based flare class labels, and attributed to extreme class imbalance because of the rarity of the major flaring events (e.g., X and M). As a performance validation metric in this class-imbalanced dataset, we used the True Skill Statistic (TSS) score. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of the MVTS learning algorithm MiniRocket, which outperformed the aforementioned classifiers without the need for essential data preprocessing steps such as normalization, statistical summarization, and class imbalance handling heuristics.},

ABSTRACT = {Solar flares are significant occurrences in solar physics, impacting space weather and terrestrial technologies. Accurate classification of solar flares is essential for predicting space weather and minimizing potential disruptions to communication, navigation, and power systems. This study addresses the challenge of selecting the most relevant features from multivariate time-series data, specifically focusing on solar flares. We employ methods such as Mutual Information (MI), Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), and Euclidean Distance to identify key features for classification. Recognizing the performance variability of different feature selection techniques, we introduce an ensemble approach to compute feature weights. By combining outputs from multiple methods, our ensemble method provides a more comprehensive understanding of the importance of features. Our results show that the ensemble approach significantly improves classification performance, achieving values 0.15 higher in True Skill Statistic (TSS) values compared to individual feature selection methods. Additionally, our method offers valuable insights into the underlying physical processes of solar flares, leading to more effective space weather forecasting and enhanced mitigation strategies for communication, navigation, and power system disruptions.},

ABSTRACT = {Streamflow prediction plays a vital role in water resources planning in order to understand the dramatic change of climatic and hydrologic variables over different time scales. In this study, we used machine learning (ML)-based prediction models, including Random Forest Regression (RFR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Seasonal Auto- Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and Facebook Prophet (PROPHET) to predict 24 months ahead of natural streamflow at the Lees Ferry site located at the bottom part of the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) of the US. Firstly, we used only historic streamflow data to predict 24 months ahead. Secondly, we considered meteorological components such as temperature and precipitation as additional features. We tested the models on a monthly test dataset spanning 6 years, where 24-month predictions were repeated 50 times to ensure the consistency of the results. Moreover, we performed a sensitivity analysis to identify our best-performing model. Later, we analyzed the effects of considering different span window sizes on the quality of predictions made by our best model. Finally, we applied our best-performing model, RFR, on two more rivers in different states in the UCRB to test the model’s generalizability. We evaluated the performance of the predictive models using multiple evaluation measures. The predictions in multivariate time-series models were found to be more accurate, with RMSE less than 0.84 mm per month, R-squared more than 0.8, and MAPE less than 0.25. Therefore, we conclude that the temperature and precipitation of the UCRB increases the accuracy of the predictions. Ultimately, we found that multivariate RFR performs the best among four models and is generalizable to other rivers in the UCRB.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for gender dysphoria is medical intervention, but many transgender and nonbinary people face significant treatment barriers when seeking help for gender dysphoria. When untreated, gender dysphoria is associated with depression, anxiety, suicidality, and substance misuse. Technology-delivered interventions for transgender and nonbinary people can be used discretely, safely, and flexibly, thereby reducing treatment barriers and increasing access to psychological interventions to manage distress that accompanies gender dysphoria. Technology-delivered interventions are beginning to incorporate machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to automate intervention components and tailor intervention content. A critical step in using ML and NLP in technology-delivered interventions is demonstrating how accurately these methods model clinical constructs. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the preliminary effectiveness of modeling gender dysphoria with ML and NLP, using transgender and nonbinary people's social media data. METHODS: Overall, 6 ML models and 949 NLP-generated independent variables were used to model gender dysphoria from the text data of 1573 Reddit posts created on transgender- and nonbinary-specific web-based forums. After developing a codebook grounded in clinical science, a research team of clinicians and students experienced in working with transgender and nonbinary clients used qualitative content analysis to determine whether gender dysphoria was present in each Reddit post. NLP (e.g., n-grams, LIWC, word embedding, sentiment, and transfer learning) was used to transform the linguistic content of each post into predictors for ML algorithms. A k-fold cross-validation was performed. Hyperparameters were tuned with random search. Feature selection was performed to demonstrate the relative importance of each NLP-generated independent variable. Misclassified posts were analyzed to improve future modeling of gender dysphoria. RESULTS: An optimized extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm modeled gender dysphoria with high accuracy (0.84), precision (0.83), and speed (1.23s). DSM-5 clinical keywords were most predictive. Misclassifications occurred in posts with uncertainty, unrelated stress, insufficient markers, past experiences, or identity exploration. CONCLUSIONS: ML- and NLP-based models of gender dysphoria have strong potential to be integrated into technology-delivered interventions and contribute to clinical science for marginalized populations.}

  abstract  = {We introduce and make openly accessible a comprehensive, multivariate time series (MVTS) dataset extracted from solar photospheric vector magnetograms in Spaceweather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARP) series. Our dataset also includes a cross-checked NOAA solar flare catalog that immediately facilitates solar flare prediction efforts. We discuss methods used for data collection, cleaning and pre-processing of the solar active region and flare data, and we further describe a novel data integration and sampling methodology. Our dataset covers 4,098 MVTS data collections from active regions occurring between May 2010 and December 2018, includes 51 flare-predictive parameters, and integrates over 10,000 flare reports. Potential directions toward expansion of the time series, either “horizontally” – by adding more prediction-specific parameters, or “vertically” – by generalizing flare into integrated solar eruption prediction, are also explained. The immediate tasks enabled by the disseminated dataset include: optimization of solar flare prediction and detailed investigation for elusive flare predictors or precursors, with both operational (research-to-operations), and basic research (operations-to-research) benefits potentially following in the future.}

    abstract = { The comprehensive set of neuronal connections of the human brain, which is known as the human connectomes, has provided valuable insight into neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has facilitated this research by capturing regionally specific brain activity. Resting state fMRI is used to extract the functional connectivity networks, which are edge-weighted complete graphs. In these complete functional connectivity networks, each node represents one brain region or Region of Interest (ROI), and each edge weight represents the strength of functional connectivity of the adjacent ROIs. In order to leverage existing graph mining methodologies, these complete graphs are often made sparse by applying thresholds on weights. This approach can result in loss of discriminative information while addressing the issue of biomarkers detection, i.e. finding discriminative ROIs and connections, given the data of healthy and disabled population. In this work, we demonstrate a novel framework for representing the complete functional connectivity networks in a threshold-free manner and identifying biomarkers by using feature selection algorithms. Additionally, to compute meaningful representations of the discriminative ROIs and connections, we apply tensor decomposition techniques. Experiments on a fMRI dataset of neurodevelopmental reading disabilities show the highly interpretable nature of our approach in finding the biomarkers of the diseases. }
